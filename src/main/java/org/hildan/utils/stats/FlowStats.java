 * This class provide statistics methods such as mean, standard deviation and

 * <p>
 * The way it works is quite simple: the {@link FlowStats} object must be fed with
 * double values through the methods {@link #add(double)} and {@link #remove(double)}
 * , and then the statistics methods can be called.
 * </p>

 * FlowStats stats = new FlowStats();
 * stats.add(1.0);
 * stats.add(4.0);
 * stats.add(4.0);
 * stats.mean(); // returns 3.0
 * stats.remove(4.0)
 * stats.mean(); // returns 2.5
 * }
